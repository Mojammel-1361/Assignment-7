                <h1>Local Storage and Session Storage Difference</h1>
                <p> <b>Local Storage: </b> This read-only interface property provides access to the Documents local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends  that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last private tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session). DOMStrings are storage formats that use UTF-16 to encode data, which uses two bytes per character. Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects. The data stored in LocalStorage is specific to a protocol in the document.</p>

            <div>
                <p> <b>Session Storage: </b> Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage objects. a pages protocol determines what data is stored in sessionStorage. Particularly, data stored by scripts accessed through HTTP is stored in a separate object from the same site accessed through HTTPS. A DOMString number is two bytes per character in UTF-16 DOMString format. Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects.</p>

                <h1>Differences Between Global Scope and Block scope</h1>
                <p> <b>Global scope : </b> Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p> <b>Block Scope: </b> The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope. ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and const keywords. These two keywords are scoped within the block which are defined. Var can declare a variable either in the global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.

                <h1>How works JavaScript Event Loop</h1>
                <p> Well start with a somewhat of an odd claim — despite allowing async JavaScript code like the setTimeout we just discussed, until ES6, JavaScript itself has actually never had any direct notion of asynchronicity built into it. The JavaScript engine has never done anything more than executing a single chunk of your program at any given moment. For more details on how JavaScript engines work Googles V8 specifically, check one of our previous articles on the topic.
                So, who tells the JS Engine to execute chunks of your program? In reality, the JS Engine doesn't run in isolation — it runs inside a hosting environment, which for most developers is the typical web browser or Node.js. Actually, nowadays, JavaScript gets embedded into all kinds of devices, from robots to light bulbs. Every single device represents a different type of hosting environment for the JS Engine.<br>
                <b>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.</b></p>

                <h1>6 primitive types undefined</h1>
                <p>
                    To find the points where the numerical expression is undefined, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve. Once we find the points where the denominator equals zero, we can say that our numerical expression is valid for all numbers except the numbers where it is undefined. undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined. In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it. A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.<br>
                    <b>6 primitive types undefined</b><br>
                    Boolean: true or false <br>
                    Number: 1, 6.7, 0xFF<br>
                    String: "Gorilla and banana"<br>
                    Symbol: Symbol("name") (starting ES2015)<br>
                    Null: null<br>
                    Undefined: undefined.<br>
                    And a separated object type: {name: "Dmitri"}, ["apple", "orange"].<br>
                    From 6 primitive types undefined is a special value with its own type Undefined. According to ECMAScript specification. Undefined value primitive value is used when a variable has not been assigned a value.
